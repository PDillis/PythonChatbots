# PythonChatbots
We will create chatbots in Python 3 from scratch using known libraries such as spaCy, Tensorflow and Rasa. This is the beginning of our journey, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

## ELIZA

The first bot we will create in order to better understand both chatbots, as well as how to structure the English language to our advantage. Find a better explanation in my blog post [here](https://pdillis.github.io/main/2018/04/24/ChatbotInPython1/).

To run, git clone this repository, then run it using the command line via:

`python ELIZA.py`

To exit the program, enter `QUIT`.
